## Favorite movie/series
**Steins; Gate**

It's an anime series that revolves around a guy trying to change history to save his love ones from their death and
a person or an organization trying to take advantage of the time machine his future self created to change the world as he see fits.

It's a really good watch. Even after countless series ive seen over the past few years, nothing still comes close to it.
